# ImageGallery
My attempt at implementing an image slideshow gallery.

This program reads from files from a specified directory and cycles through them in the form of a slideshow.
There are buttons that allow the user to pause, skip, and go back to the previous image. There is also a 
settings button which allows the user to modify the speed of the slideshow. 

Here are some screen shots of the running application.
